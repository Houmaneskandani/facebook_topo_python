# facebook_topo_python
  In this project, I use Mininet to emulate a network topology consisting of one server and
three client nodes and implement a simple Facebook application on top of this topology using a
client - server model. Clients run client codes to make use of the capabilities they are provided
with and the server is responsible for authenticating users, receiving posts and messages from
users and sending them to the proper intended recipient
